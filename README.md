# Rogue AA Meeting Script Generator

A web-based tool to generate Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting scripts for secretaries and co-hosts, with features to copy text and images to the clipboard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, styled with an Apple-inspired design, and powered by `html2canvas` for image generation.

## Features
- **Secretary Script Generation**: Select a day, enter your name, choose readings, and generate a formatted AA meeting script.
- **Co-Host Instructions**: Provides pre-formatted text and images (e.g., Safety Card, 7th Tradition) for co-hosts to post during meetings.
- **Clipboard Support**: Copy scripts and sections as text or images, with segmented copying for long texts.
- **Modular Design**: Separated into `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `readings.js` for easy updates.
